# Foodie and Yummy

This is a website that makes it easier for customers to order anything they would like to be served and is available in the restaurant. A user is displayed with a list of all drinks and meals available. All they do is order the food and confirm the purchase and the bar attendees would gladly have them served on time.Once they have ordered, they are notified that they will be served on a specific table.

## Description

Foodie and yummy is an application that allows customers to view the menu and place an order, and has a graphical user interface that enables the restaurant attendees to access what the customers have ordered based on their tables and administer to them. Customers can view any food that is offered, and drinks, and also get to see reviews of their fellow customers concerning a specific food type they took. In conjunction to this, ordering food is made easier.

## Future implementations
I am looking forward to adding a search music API that allows the customers to interact with the dj and request a music of their choice. The dj would then get the request and play music based on the ones with highest number of suggestions. Further more, I plan to make this application become a fullstack web application and later come up with a mobile application from it.
