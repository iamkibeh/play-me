## Description

Play me is an application that allows customers to view the menu and place an order, and has a graphical user interface that enables the restaurant attendees to access what the customers have ordered based on their tables and administer to them. Customers can view any food that is offered, andy drinks, and also get to see reviews of their fellow customers concerning a specific food type they took. In conjunction to this, ordering food is made easier.
